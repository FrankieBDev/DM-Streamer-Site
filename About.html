<h2>About </h2>
<p>My first mini project uses just HTML and CSS.  Live streaming is a hobby of mine which I developed over lockdown in 2020/ 2021.  Up until halfway through the pandemic didn’t have a clue what ‘Twitch’ or even live streaming really was but I quickly become immersed in the world of Twitch.  Whilst I had plenty of free time, I streamed almost daily from my PlayStation 4, created crude clip videos using my Ipad, developed social media pages a small and loyal follower base. <br><br>  Nowadays I have many more commitments and am more of an occasional streamer.  However, I am still proud of the developments I made.  From starting off with pretty bad quality streams straight from my PS4 to slightly more professional streams that I do from my PC.  

    This journey has involved me buying a PC after not owning a computer at all for a number of years due to travelling (I managed to get by with an Ipad and a smart phone), and teaching myself how to use streaming software, video editing, photo editing and various other types of software to create various projects and add ons.  You can check out a few bits <!--link--> here.

    This site is an imagination of something I might have created for myself, had I taken my ‘Danger666Monkey’ brand to the next level.

<h3>What the Hell is with the name? </h3>
<p>
‘Danger666Monkey’ has been my ‘gamertag’ or username I’ve used for gaming on all platforms since I was a teenager.  Back in 2003 I thought it was “well cool”.  Since I originally started Twitch streaming as a way to find people online to play with it just made sense to use that same handle.  It stuck and it’s what people now know me as on the platform.  I also really like the colour scheme and monkey designs.  It’s kind of nostalgic and makes a reference to some particular memories from my childhood.
