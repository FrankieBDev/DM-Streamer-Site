# About 'DM Streamer Site'
A responsive static site for my Twitch channel.  
This was my first attempt at a full static site after learning basic HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.  

# Design 
I initally created a template in Canva to allow me to easily experiment with colour schemes and placement.  This also gave me a nice visual reference.

# Positive Features
- When I first created this I was generally quite proud that I had created something that looked like an actual website AND was (somewhat) responsive.
- I really like the 'hover' over the nav bar titles and the button links on the home page.  They change colour when the pointer hovers over them and makes it very clear that they are links and which section one will be directed to. 
- All links work correctly.
- Though I had to remove the clips as the videos were too big to upload to Github, I was able to successfully link videos and images to the page.
- Consistency in design throughout.

# Struggles
- I struggled initally using flexbox and media queries. I found alot of elements would not align quite as I wanted them to.
- I also attempted creating a Nav bar from scratch which was quite the challenge.  I eventually settled for using Bootstrap as a guide and edited to make it look how I wanted.

# Improvements
I am uploading this about two months after creation (Oct 2022) as I didn't yet know what Github was or how to use it.  
With the knowledge I have now there are quite alot of imporvements I would make to this site including:
- Design improvements such as nav bar background stretching across whole top of the page and larger nav.
- Better sizing changes.  Responsive but at some sizes looks a little weird.
- A merch page would have been cool to do.  I was originally going to create one with just images but I ran out of time.  I'd like to learn how to actually develop retail features and the ability to 'add to cart etc'.
- Add in 'alt' text as not used.
- Better mark up in code.
